# About

Welcome to Andrew's blog! I'm a **Computer Science** student at Southwest Jiaotong University in China. My study of **algorithms** began in September 2020, when I was 14 years old. I'm also interested in other areas of Computer Science, **such as** Cyber Security.  [Contact me](https://www.instagram.com/SuWang_06/) if there's any questions about the articles.

I like to play video games especially **Counter Strike**, and my home team is [@Falcons Esports](https://x.com/FalconsEsport). I like [Leehom](https://www.instagram.com/wangleehom/) and [Mercedes AMG F1](https://x.com/MercedesAMGF1) too.
